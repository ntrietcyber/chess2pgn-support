      <h1>Chess2PGN – Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last updated: November 20, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <span class="highlight">Chess2PGN</span> (“the App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”)
        collects, uses, and protects information when you use the App.
      </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Chess2PGN is designed as a utility app for converting chess scoresheets into PGN and analyzing games. The App does not require you to create an account to use basic features.</p>
        <p>Depending on how you use the App, we may process the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="highlight">Images of scoresheets:</span> Photos you choose to upload for conversion to PGN.</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Game data:</span> Reconstructed PGN moves, analysis results, and related chess metadata.</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Device information (limited):</span> Basic technical information such as device model, operating system version, and app version, which may be used for debugging and improving performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, or contact details through the App, unless you voluntarily provide it (for example, if you contact us by email).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information described above solely to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Convert your scoresheet images into PGN format.</li>
          <li>Provide optional analysis, tips, and feedback on your chess games.</li>
          <li>Store and display your games and analysis history within the App.</li>
          <li>Maintain and improve the App’s reliability, performance, and features.</li>
          <li>Diagnose and fix technical issues.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Data Processing and Storage</h2>
        <p>
          Scoresheet images and game data may be sent securely to our servers to perform optical character recognition (OCR), game reconstruction, and analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to retain only the data necessary to provide the App’s functionality. Images and derived data may be stored for a limited time to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow you to view or re-use previously converted games.</li>
          <li>Improve accuracy and reliability of the App’s features.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where possible, we avoid storing images longer than needed for processing and basic functionality. Game data (PGN and analysis) may be stored longer so you can review your game history.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          The App may use third-party services (such as cloud hosting, analytics, or machine learning APIs) to provide features like OCR, game reconstruction, or performance monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          These services are used only to support the core functionality of the App and are required to process data on our behalf. We do not sell your data to third parties.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Chess2PGN is suitable for use by players of all ages, including children, but it is intended to be used under the supervision of a parent, guardian, or coach when used by minors.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including the use of secure connections (such as HTTPS) when transmitting data between the App and our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
        <p>
          You can choose not to upload certain images or game data if you prefer not to have them processed. You may also uninstall the App at any time, which stops all future data collection from your device.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to request deletion of data associated with your use of the App (where reasonably identifiable), please contact us using the email below, and we will make a reasonable effort to honor your request, subject to any legal or technical limitations.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App or applicable laws. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes are posted will constitute your acknowledgment of the updated policy.
